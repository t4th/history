# history

My favorite way of learning new technologies is to re-implement the wheel. Finding implementation constraints while exploring  ways of solving the problem are one of the best experiences to get in my opinion. 

This repo is graveyard for such old projects. Never (indented) to be finished, but full of sentiment milestones on my site.

Obviously these are full of weird paradigms, silly error mistakes or weird name decisions, but well - I'm not ashamed of being once a beginner :).
