# FindTextInFiles

Goal of this program was to mimic my favorite Total Commander freature: ALT + F7 -> ALT + t, a'ka search for phrase in files.

Of course most optimal would be using windows bash, linux grep or free Double Commander for the same/better results.

This is simple sequential program using native windows API.
